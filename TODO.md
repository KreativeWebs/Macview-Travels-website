# TODO: Update Flash Sales Display for Admins and Frontend

## Tasks to Complete

- [ ] Add `getAllFlashSales` function to `backend/controllers/adminController.js` to fetch all flash sales (not just active ones) for admin view.
- [ ] Update the GET "/" route in `backend/routes/flashSaleRoutes.js` to fetch all flash sales instead of only active ones, so the frontend can display all newly created flash sales in slides.
