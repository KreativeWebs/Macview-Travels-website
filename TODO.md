# TODO: Make signup modal height adjust automatically when PasswordStrength shows

- [x] Modify modal-content height to be dynamic: 750px when hidden, 820px when shown
- [x] Add smooth transition animation (0.3s ease) for height change
- [x] Test: Modal starts at 750px height, expands to 820px when PasswordStrength appears
- [x] Test: Modal shrinks back to 750px when reopened (PasswordStrength hidden)
- [x] Test smooth animation during height transitions
- [x] Ensure no layout issues or content cutoff during transitions
